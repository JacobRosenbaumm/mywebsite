<p>We went to the City of wind, Chicago. It was a great time seeing my grandparents. They are really funny and have stories that make all of us laugh.
Most of the time they will forget things and that is kinda a problem, but it's fine and doesnt really affect much.
Also it was her birthday and she is turning 71 and she doesnt want to get older. She says when she turns 80 she wants to skydive off a plane.
Grandpa says no but we will see.</p>

<p>We had her Birthday at some BBQ place that was really good and they did the samething as most places like sing and give dessert.

<p>The next day we went to the Lincon park zoo and the day after that we went to Navy Pier.
Both were really fun and we got see some cute animals and the pier was nice, I also got a swearshirt from their even though I lost it already.</p>
