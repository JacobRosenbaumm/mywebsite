<p>In this trip we planned to see my grandparents and how they were doing. We do this every year so it wasn't a new thing for my family,
We usually do the samething each year and this year was no different. Basically we see our grandparents,get good food, have a good time, 
but this time we have to move my Grandaparents from Connecticut to a different house.</p>
